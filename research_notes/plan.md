# Code Migration for Non-compliant Window Co-occurence pattern detection

As a part of this project, I would be completing multiple phases as described below:
1. **Onboarding**: 
    - Getting familiar with the research by Reem Y. Ali on algorithms for NWC Pattern discovery
    - Demystifying current Java codebase (through debugging)
    - `Components`:
        - Data Input
        - Discretizer
        - Finding anomalous windows
        - Counting candidate patterns using State Graphs (Mining)
        - Pruning (Using thresholds)
        - Results Output

2. **Designing**: 
    - Understanding the requirements for the codebase to plan for interfaces in the code
    - Using design patterns to come up with a modular and extensible design
    - Making package for generic use case

3. **Implementation**:
    - Setting up version control
    - Writing code in Python (looking for possible optimisations)
    - Creating a test bed with unit-test cases (Priority for this might vary depending upon timeline and urgency for the codebase).

4. **Packaging**:
    - Documenting design decisions and best practises followed during development
    - Write descriptive details about modules implemented, thus filling gaps in current documentation for the code.
    - Making it accessible to open-source community through proper packaging and dependency management instructions.
